# Trojan_Demo
Not trying to reinvent the wheel, but trying to see if I could write and execute a basic trojan script on another computer.

## Information
Do NOT use this. This was an demo and an test of my programming skills. 
Note that you must not have an directory called 'Injection' for this to work.
